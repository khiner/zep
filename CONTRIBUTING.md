# Contributing to Zep

[This branch of Zep](https://github.com/khiner/zep) has diverged a lot
from [Rezonality's original repo](https://github.com/Rezonality/zep).

**Please contribute Zep fixes or improvements to https://github.com/Rezonality/zep.**

The plan for this branch is to whittle down and customize a great deal how Zep works, especially in terms of state/event
management.

I'm only trying to suit the needs of the [flowgrid](https://github.com/khiner/flowgrid2) application here in this
branch.
